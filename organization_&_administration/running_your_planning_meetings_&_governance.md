## Running your Planning Meetings & Governance {#running-your-planning-meetings-governance}

**In your founding process, you have to be _now_ what you intend to create _later_** to start an Agile Learning Center. We use agile tools with children because they work. **Use the same tools with your team** that you’ll use with the children. This way your leadership, families and staff will start to gain mastery of the tools that provide structure for producing results. [See the Facilitation section for more info about ALC tools and practices.]

This practice is also important for establishing agile habits and an agile culture. If you can’t make decisions effectively when you only have a handful of adults in a planning meeting, you certainly won’t be able to do so while crunched for time and energy while operating the school with dozens of kids added to the mix. **Establish healthy patterns now**. Use Kanban Boards (physical or [virtual](https://trello.com/)) to manage the tasks you need to complete. Use GameShifting for meetings with more than two or three people. Use the Community Mastery Board (CMB) to run better meetings while developing your culture and make your team’s norms and expectations explicit and clear.

You should be able to make most decisions through a Change-Up / CMB process. And when more official minutes are required (for legal purposes such as opening a bank account), the sticky notes on a CMB can be translated into more formal minutes. We recommend always using agile processes over the bureaucratic decision-making patterns of other organizations, which may be difficult to change later.

Step 1: Visit the Tools Section of the Kit and start a Kanban board for your ALC.  You may use the Step 1 activities as your first items on the board, if you like.
