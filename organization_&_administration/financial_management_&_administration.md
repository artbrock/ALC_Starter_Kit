## Financial Management & Administration {#financial-management-administration}

It seems like most people who are passionate progressive educators do not usually have a lot of experience with the details of running a business. We have seen numerous competent people become overwhelmed with managing the business details of their school. For this reason, we recommend that you eliminate as much paperwork and detail management as possible by automating tuition payments, bank deposits, bill payments, payroll deposits, and tax payments. When these things are working smoothly, the remaining details don’t feel so overwhelming.

### Projecting & Managing Cashflow {#projecting-managing-cashflow}

Your budgeting in the financial planning section provides a basic framework and spending priorities, but the day-to-day reality of managing money is never quite as simple as the budget implies. The better you get and understanding and managing the timing of your money inflows and outflows, the more of it you can automate and reclaim time and energy from managing the details of, because you know the money will be in before it needs to go out.

#### Principles of Good Cashflow Management {#principles-of-good-cashflow-management}

Some of these are obvious, but that doesn’t mean they’re easy. Most of us do not enjoy having the challenging conversations that are sometimes required to get cash in the door. We all want to be flexible and compassionate of others financial challenges. If your school has enough cash reserves or reliable revenue flow, then you may be able to afford the luxury of being flexible with a very few families.

Don’t make it a habit of allowing one person’s financial problem to turn into a problem for everyone else too, unless you’re willing to risk losing staff because you can’t pay them, or losing your site because you’re paying rent on time. Build some cashflow muscles by practicing these principles.

*   **Be clear about WHEN you get paid**. Your enrollment contracts need to specify both amount and timing of payment. When possible, automate those payments to happen on those dates with no delays. Of course, a related issue is being clear about WHEN you have to pay -- rent, insurance, payroll, bills, etc.
*   **Don’t spend what you don’t have.** On one level this means don’t spend money that isn’t in your account, but on a deeper level, it also means you have to have the timing of money set to arrive BEFORE you perform the services someone is paying for. For example, if your fiscal year starts in July, your school year starts in September, and you’re paying your staff year-round, then you are two months into paying your staff before the students show up. The tuition deposit should have covered that, but the next payment should probably be by September 1st, that way, if there is a problem with a family paying it, you are resolving that problem while you’re providing your service not after.
*   **Always keep a margin of error.** Ideally, you will have some cash reserves that you are not spending in the case of normal affairs, or at least a line of credit that you can draw on if rent or payroll needs to get paid before some money comes in. But this also means that you should learn _how much_ you should be **under**estimating your income, and **over**estimating your expenses. You will lose some families and students and have some unexpected expenses; it happens. Get used to managing your cashflow with an appropriate margin of error for these things.

When the timing and margins for income and expenses are clear, then you want to make sure you can have a nice automated cycle where you are getting paid before paying and then you can just schedule all the payments. Sometimes this may require a small fundraising effort just to get your cycle lined up well, because once your cycle of inflows and outflows is timed well, it takes very little attention and energy to sustain it. However, it will waste a lot of people’s time and energy when it’s not timed well and be a continual source of stress and distraction from your deeper purpose.

### Getting Started with Admin Automation: {#getting-started-with-admin-automation}

*   **Just hire a small accounting firm** for some of these tasks (bookkeeping, paycheck processing, payroll taxes, and annual tax forms). It may seem like you don’t have the money to pay one, but the lost energy from being stressed about these things will detract more from the value and culture of your school than the accountant will cost. You should be able to find a firm willing to do it all for around $200 per month. Use the time saved to find another student which should more than pay for it.
*   **Pay the small transaction fees** to have people pay their tuition electronically and have it automatically deposited to your bank account. See below for how to set this up using Quickbooks.
*   **Direct deposit of paychecks** will reduce your staff’s stress too.
*   **Set up automatic payments from your bank account** for your rent, utilities, and liability insurance.

Some people are afraid of automating these things, thinking “What if the money isn’t there?” However, wasting time juggling these kinds of details helps ensure your attention is NOT on enrolling new students which is the real way for the money to be there. Shift energy from repetitive administrative tasks to building the conversation about the school in the community and supporting a healthy culture at the school. I can assure you that stressed out administrators do NOT improve the culture for staff or students.

### Tuition Collections & Tracking {#tuition-collections-tracking}

Once you set up a clear sliding scale system and have a workgroup to share the responsibility of your ALC’s financial stability, you’ll need to set up a system for collecting and tracking tuition payments. There are several services that can be used for this process and certainly new ones are being developed all the time -- the key is finding one you can navigate easily, is reasonably affordable, and can streamline many of your financial/administrative processes. It may take some time to set these things up, but the initial investment will definitely pay off quickly when you eliminate the need to manually track who has paid and who has not, track people down and ask them for checks, make never-ending trips to the bank to deposit checks, and manually update your books.

We’ve found [Intuit’s Quickbooks Online](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/online) and [Quickbooks Payments](http://quickbooks.intuit.com/payments/) SAAS (software as a service) to be an effective tool for this process. Quickbooks Online is the accounting software and Quickbooks Payments is an add-on service for generating invoices and send/receiving payments online. Using these two services together allows you to create a customer base comprised of each family, set up recurring invoices that get sent out automatically each month, collect tuition payments electronically and have them integrated into the bookkeeping/accounting process automatically.

Depending on the payment plan you choose and if you plan to use Quickbooks for payroll processing, monthly costs are between $25-$50\. You can add Quickbooks Payments for no extra cost if you use the “pay as you go” approach -- this plan is most effective for smaller schools that don’t need to be processing credit cards or daily transactions at a high volume.
