## Document Management {#document-management}

Mostly likely, your founding team doesn’t live all in one house, or you don’t have a dedicated file server for your school. It can save a lot of time in the long run to start out by setting up online document sharing. Google Apps for Education provides a lot of storage space as well as spreadsheet and word processing tools. See HOW-TO SET UP GOOGLE APPS.

If you don’t want to use Google, there’s file-sharing apps like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) or many other cloud storage options. There are even open source options if you want to run your own server.

Set up a good directory structure sharing documents and encourage everyone on your team to share their documents in a central shared place. In the long run, it will save a lot of time chasing down records and files and safeguard against turnover of personnel who end up being the only one with a copy of certain file.

**Notes:** Remember that not everyone’s strength is in administrative work. Sometimes a good administrator can distribute those roles.
