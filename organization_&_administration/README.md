# Organization & Administration {#organization-administration}

Congratulations for being a visionary committed to creating a powerful direction for education! We hope that by learning from others' journeys in the Starter Kit and through our websites, you will be able to get started as easily as possible.  The ALC community's support and experience will help you get from your starting point today through opening your doors and operating successfully.  We'll be counting on you to ask questions and share your stories as you progress, too.

Starting a school can be an overwhelming project. At a minimum, you're trying to pull together students, staff, sponsors and a location. Getting these groups in harmony is tough: many parents won't enroll without a location, for example, but the location wants to see enrollments to sign a lease. It's great to start with at least some of these ingredients \(students, money or real estate\).  An ALC from scratch can, and has, been done before, though.

This document has cross links to content in other sections, and it can be a lot to absorb in one reading. We encourage you to visit an ALC as soon as you can to convert what you read here into real-life experience.
