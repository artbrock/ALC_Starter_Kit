## Building a Founding Team {#building-a-founding-team}

You should find and build your team of co-founders as quickly as possible. As long as you’re holding this alone, it’s subject to the limitations of any personal project. The Agile Learning Center really becomes a vibrant reality when is is a team of people holding the vision, doing the work together, and speaking to their friends, family and network about it.

You want to partner with people who look at the [Agile Tree](../communication_&_promotion/alc_educational_model_-_an_agile_tree.md) (Soil, Roots, Branches, & Leaves) and feel like it expresses their personal commitment to children and education. You want people who will actively and consistently work with you and keep their promises to get things done.

It is very easy to find people (parents or otherwise) who want to talk about things, think about things, and tell you what you should do. Those people can be helpful as advisors, supporters or part of your growing community of participants. If they are not active in doing the work to actually launch the school, then they may be best seen solely as founding families, potential staff or volunteers. In that case, they are not really part the founding team and should not be included in work sessions where you need to produce results.

Your co-founders will carry the responsibility of starting the school with you. You need to be able to trust each other, have clear communication and challenging and uncomfortable conversations with them. You will confront many struggles together. It will be useful to make sure you have people with some particular skills, gifts and talents such as:

### Warm / Welcoming / Intuitive {#warm-welcoming-intuitive}

*   Keeping a team together is not just about the work. In times of confusion or disagreement it is critical that you have someone who can hold the group, make everyone feel safe, and have a strong sense of individual and group needs to help heal tension and conflict. They can also make newcomers feel welcome and help grow your team.

### **Outgoing / Communicati**ve **/ Social** {#outgoing-communicative-social}

*   At least one person will need to be actively spreading the word and being a spokesperson for the school. Ideally, you will have many people sharing and talking, but at least one needs to intentionally develop skills to speak clearly about the educational model. They should be willing to be accountable for getting kids in the door by making calls, returning emails, and leading events. [See communications section for more support.]

### **Detail-Oriented / Organiz**ed {#detail-oriented-organized}

*    There are a lot of details to manage -- like filing legal documents, getting insurance, setting up bookkeeping and payroll, setting up infrastructure for sharing documents, taking minutes, and organizing and keeping records. Someone on your team needs to be willing to be accountable for these kinds of details, or at some point the details will overwhelm a poorly organized team.

### Charismatic / Figurehead / Charismatic Leader {#charismatic-figurehead-charismatic-leader}

*  Some say a startup school must have a strong leader. Indeed, it is often valuable for parents and community members to have one main person in which to put their confidence. This kind of leader can be a powerful asset as long as their ego doesn’t get in the way of empowering and helping to grow other leaders. Generally, people seeking positions of power and authority don’t fit well in an ALC since it is designed to empower everyone’s leadership, even in the children’s.More important than charisma is the ability to hold coherence for the vision of what you’re building - to organize people, resources, and conversations in support of that vision coming into being. You can use agile processes to call forth leadership from _everyone_ in different domains that don’t need one main charismatic leader. Rally behind a good leader if you have one, but don’t forget community should always maintain enough collective strength to part ways with anyone who is derailing things from an appropriate path. Using GameShifting in your meetings will help you practice shifting power dynamics keeping you from getting stuck in one pattern of authority.
