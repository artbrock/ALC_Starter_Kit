## Employment: Hiring, Contracting & Firing People {#employment-hiring-contracting-firing-people}

### Hiring Process/Practices/Requirements {#hiring-process-practices-requirements}

Warning: Avoid discriminatory questions in your application or interview that would provide any basis for discrimination against a protected class. Don’t ask about age, race, religion, sexual orientation, etc. **Focus on what you’re looking for** in a candidate -- someone who is good with kids, a good communicator, detail-oriented, or whatever it is you’re hiring for.

Some kind of trial period when both employer and employee know their status will be re-evaluated can be very powerful for removing people who make good early impressions but prove to be unreliable in other ways. As much as possible, have people come visit, spend time with staff and students and get feedback from the community about everyone’s comfort with hiring a person. Listen carefully to student feedback. There is usually important insight from it.

### Contracts {#contracts}

Clear contracts for employees or contractors are important to avoid any hard feelings and resentments that come from sloppy communications about expectations around work, pay or performance. At least provide a brief outline of payment amounts, payment timelines, and accountabilities and expected commitments/hours/attendance. Also, understand that if you specify the time, place or manner of someone’s work, the IRS will consider them an employee and not a contractor and they’ll be subject to all payroll taxes and insurance.

### Payroll Set-up and Administration {#payroll-set-up-and-administration}

In the USA, and in many other places, managing payroll is pretty complex process. Taxes and required forms of insurance on Federal, State, County and City levels are supposed to be withheld from employee paychecks and/or paid by the employe to appropriate government agencies on either a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the size of your staff.

In order to get all these figures right and payments sent to the right places, at the bare minimum, you need to use accounting software which calculates it all for you (such a QuickBooks) or have another company process and manage your payroll. We recommend finding a small and friendly accounting firm who will process your payroll, help you keep your bookkeeping and financial statements updated as well as file your required annual reports rather than just a payroll processing company who will only process payroll and probably cost a similar amount as the accounting firm.

They should also be able to advise you on keeping your employment practices in compliance with regard to health benefits, workers compensation, unemployment insurance, overtime pay, vacation policies, posting of required notices and such things. It is hard to keep track of all these things yourself, so this is a domain we recommend you find people you can trust to advise you.

Step 1: To make sure everyone's on the same page, have the entire Founding team talk about what roles should be filled by employees and the specific qualities your ALC would like in each employee role.
