## Volunteers {#volunteers}

Part of what makes a rich learning environment is having passionate adults that are excited about things and willing to share them with kids. You can augment your basic staffing levels with parents, young adults, or not-so-young adults who are interesting people. A big part of what makes someone interesting is that they have keen interests in things.

However, in today’s world there are some common-sense steps to take to safeguard your environment for the children (and for overprotective parents).

**Validate Identity:** We have volunteers complete a web-based form with complete contact information (full name, address, phone, drivers licens #, etc.). We also have a checkbox on that form where they agree to authorize us to do a criminal background check on them. When they come in to the school for the first time, we make a copy of their ID to keep on file.

**Background Checks:** Once you have authorization and identifying information for doing a background, then obviously you can do one. Truthfully, we don’t always do them, since many of our volunteers have come in through long-standing personal connections and a check has seemed unnecessary, however, it’s important to get this authorization even if you don’t immediately use it. Requiring the authorization on the initial application may also deter people with predatory intentions from applying.

**Requirements:** Some states and locales have laws against some people (with particular criminal histories) working with children. In any case, most parents would likely be uncomfortable with people with past violent or sexual offenses working with their children. You’ll need to define your own policies in this domain. Just remember, that having everybody feel safe is a vital part of creating a healthy culture in the school. Sometimes that even means there are fear-mongering parents that are not a fit because their extreme fears breed a culture of fear. However, this is one domain where it is smart to set some clear boundaries that you can honor.

**Agreements:** Establishing a culture of integrity where people keep their agreements is important whether staff, student or volunteer. Be sure the make the agreements you’re asking people to follow very clear. Will they be in 2 days a week? Tuesday/Thursday mornings? What time? How long? Is any preparation expected? It’s worth getting these kinds of things clear early for managing everyone’s expectations.

Step 1: Establish your organization’s boundaries for volunteers regarding criminal backgrounds and records, being mindful of any local laws, and apply these boundaries to your current team.
