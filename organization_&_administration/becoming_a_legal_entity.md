## Becoming a Legal Entity {#becoming-a-legal-entity}

{% aside "callout", "warning" %}
**Disclaimer:** This section is written by entrepreneurs and educators, not lawyers and accountants. We cannot provide official legal or financial advice. Also, laws vary by state and country. We’ll try to expand our guide for countries outside the U.S., but this high-level overview of issues will still help.  Please consult a local lawyer to be sure you are in compliance, and we recommend hiring accountants for your bookkeeping, payroll & taxes.

### Do you need to incorporate? {#do-you-need-to-incorporate}

If you are going to create an actual school, yes.  To get insured, or get a bank account, you may need the legal incorporation. However, a homeschool group using our tools may be able to operate as an informal association or cooperative. 

In the United States there are laws supporting Freedom of Association (backed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments) which typically allow clubs, cooperatives and associations to be recognized as a named entity without officially incorporating. Often you will need to file a DBA (“Doing Business As”) or Trade Name Registration in your state, then apply for a Federal EIN to get a bank account.

### How to incorporate {#how-to-incorporate}

If you decide to incorporate, in most states, you can just submit a business registration online through your Secretary of State to file your initial Articles of Incorporation. On average, states charge about $50 to file. After that you’ll still need to apply for a Federal EIN to be able to open a bank account. If you are running a school, camp, or after school program, you’ll probably want to do both of these things.

{% aside "callout", "option" %} For an ALC, we recommend establishing yourself as a non-profit organization so that the power is truly held by the community, not a small cabal of shareholders. {% endaside %}

{% aside "story" %} Some states have special provisions and requirements for educational organizations and do NOT follow the normal process of incorporation. In New York, for example, you need to file a Charter with the New York State University Board of Regents and are subject to their approval and oversight.{% endaside %}

### Legal Structure and Bylaws {#legal-structure-and-bylaws}

We recommend walking the talk in your legal structure too. Agile Learning Centers are rooted in trust. They are designed to support people contributing their gifts and talents, pursuing their passions, and being inclusive and participatory. As such, we recommend making a legal structure which reflects this participatory nature by including parents, staff, community and when possible, students, in the operation of the school. (Some states prohibit the inclusion of minors on boards or other legal decision-making bodies.)

The following is a thorough example of an Organizational Structure for an Agile Learning Center. It includes a number of optional components (slightly greyed out) which you could remove for a simplified organization.

#### Sample Organizational Chart {#sample-organizational-chart}

So, let’s explore the elements in this diagram, why they exist and what they do. We’ll start with the easiest ones to talk about and remove if you want to simplify the model.

{% aside "story" %} New York State University Board of Regents: Occasionally, a state will have a say in your operations.  The NYSU Board of Regents is actually the final arbiter of any changes to a school’s Charter in New York, for example. Most states don’t have this kind of requirement, so it can be removed altogether in those cases.{% endaside %}

**Volunteers:** Volunteers do not need to be acknowledged in the legal structure of the organization. It is included to show that they are a group of stakeholders overseen by the School Administration and specifically the Staff.

**Advisors:** You may want to show how advisors will help, but not be liable for, the school.  This allows you to include community members while not making them leaders nor making them liable for the organization. You can leave them out of your bylaws, or include the possibility of electing them and just leave that body empty of members.

**Charter Council:** This is a small group (around 5) of vision-holders who will hold true to the core purpose of the organization.

{% aside "callout", "option" %} The Charter Council provides a backstop from a “hostile takeover” by a group who might want to take the school in a completely different direction. {% endaside %} The Charter Council has only one power: to rewrite the bylaws.  They can legally restructure the school to disband the Assembly or any other group. Generally, they probably only need to meet once a year just to make sure the legal structures are still aligned with the school’s vision. Remember: Some people can be members of multiple bodies (e.g. Charter Council, Assembly & Staff).

**Assembly:** This body operates as the School Board or the Board of Directors of the organization.   Assembly meetings have two parts. First, the workgroups make plans, decisions, and schedules and create their summary.  Second, the workgroups share their progress and the whole group conducts any other business.

The actual policymaking gets done in those smaller workgroups from this Assembly. As a big group, the Assembly elects its own members, advisors and officers, approves the budget and staff appointments, proposes changes to bylaws, and empowers the School Administration for daily operations.

{% aside "story" %} In NYC, we’ve taken the approach of having the first signer on a student’s Enrollment Agreement be a family’s representative on the board (even if they never come to a meeting). This practice does two things: gives the family ownership in the school right away, but also provides liability protection from frivolous lawsuits.  If they wanted to sue the school for some policy, or attempt to “pierce the corporate veil” for neglect of fiduciary duties, they would essentially be accusing and suing themselves as well. {% endaside %}

**Work Committees:** These are also called “workgroups” in this document. This is where the real work of the Assembly happens. Workgroups are the Finance Committee, Admissions Committee, Marketing & Outreach, etc. 

**School Administration:** In an Agile Learning Center, the School Administration handles the daily operation and facilitation of the school environment. It includes the students, staff, Director and potentially other Officers. It also clarifies some of the accountabilities of the adults versus the children. {% aside "callout", "warning" %} Adults are legally responsible for safety, legal compliance, financial responsibility, and supervision of volunteers. Admissions and Expulsions may include feedback from students, but adults are still accountable for the final decision. We've found allowing the students to be accountable for admissions and expulsions isn't productive.  Also, the law treats the adults (not children) as accountable for discrimination or emotional damage lawsuits. {% endaside %} Most other decisions affecting students’ time, attention, and behavior involve the students. 

{% aside "callout", "option" %} Currently, most ALCs do this through a Change-Up Meeting.  The meeting uses the Community Mastery Board, and is designed to be agile.  Students are active in every part of the process, including the way the decisions get made.{% endaside %}

 Note: Some people wonder whether ALCs are like Democratic Free Schools. The answer is mostly “Yes, of course.” However, this is a core difference: we don’t use a bureaucratic / democratic meeting revolving around a fixed process (like Robert’s Rules of Order or Butler’s Consensus). We've noticed they make an inflexible culture. Once you’ve spent dozens of hours getting a rule or policy made, you don’t want to change it, even if it isn’t working. We want everyone to test and try changes, undo them, and try again until the environment feels best for all.

### 501(c)3 Tax Exempt Status {#501-c-3-tax-exempt-status}

Schools as educational organizations generally qualify for 501c3 tax exempt status with the IRS. That status makes donations tax deductible for the donors and may qualify you for special grants or funding. However, the application is long, complex and can take months of back-and-forth to get approved. 

{% aside "callout", "warning" %} This is not a good use of time and energy in early stages of a start-up, since approval may be retroactively applied to 2 years of contributions. {% endaside %}

For early stage operations, crowdfunding campaigns, or significant donations, you may want to use another 501c3 organization as a Fiscal Sponsor. Typically, a fiscal sponsor will charge a 5-10% administrative fee and need reports on how the money was used so that their records for the IRS are complete. The Agile Learning Centers Network is willing to provide fiscal sponsorship to start-up groups who are agile organizations creating educational spaces for self-directed learning. Please contact us to explore establishing that kind of relationship.

Step 1: Consider what kind of entity you plan to start (private school, homeschool co-op) and map out your legal structure in preparation for drafting bylaws.  In the next section, you’ll investigate your local laws to ensure you’ve chosen the best structure for your needs and location.
