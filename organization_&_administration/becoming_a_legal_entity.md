## Becoming a Legal Entity {#becoming-a-legal-entity}

**Disclaimer:** This is written by entrepreneurs and educators, not lawyers and accountants. We cannot provide official legal or financial advice. Also, laws vary by state and country. We’ll try to expand our documentation for countries outside the U.S., but this high-level overview of issues illustrates some of legal and financial decisions you’ll need to make. Please consult a lawyer familiar with the laws in your area to be sure you are in full compliance, and we recommend hiring accountants for your bookkeeping, payroll & taxes.

### Do you need to incorporate? {#do-you-need-to-incorporate}

If you are going to create an actual school you will almost surely need to incorporate; however, a homeschooling collective using our tools may be able to operate as an informal association or cooperative. Needs for opening a bank account or purchasing insurance may shape your decision. To get insured, you may need to become a more standard legal entity.

In the United States there are laws supporting Freedom of Association (backed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments) which typically allow clubs, cooperatives and associations to be recognized as a named entity without officially incorporating. Often you will need to file a DBA (“Doing Business As”) or Trade Name Registration in your state, then [apply for a Federal EIN](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp) to get a bank account.

### How to incorporate {#how-to-incorporate}

If you decide to incorporate, in most states, you can just submit a business registration online through your Secretary of State to file your initial Articles of Incorporation. On average, states charge about $50 to file. After that you’ll still need to [apply for a Federal EIN](https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp) to be able to open a bank account. If you are running a school, camp, or after school program, you’ll probably want to do both of these things. For an ALC, we recommend establishing yourself as a non-profit organization so that the power is truly held by the community, not a small cabal of shareholders.

Some [states have special provisions and requirements for educational organizations](https://www2.ed.gov/admins/comm/choice/regprivschl/regprivschl.pdf) and do NOT follow the normal process of incorporation. In New York, for example, you need to [file a Charter](http://www.counsel.nysed.gov/charters) with the [New York State University Board of Regents](http://www.regents.nysed.gov/) and are subject to their approval and oversight.

### Legal Structure and Bylaws {#legal-structure-and-bylaws}

We recommend walking the talk in your legal structure too. Agile Learning Centers are rooted in trust. They are designed to support people contributing their gifts and talents, pursuing their passions, and being inclusive and participatory. As such, we recommend making a legal structure which reflects this participatory nature by including parents, staff, community and when possible, students, in the operation of the school. (Some states prohibit the inclusion of minors on boards or other legal decision-making bodies.)

The following is a thorough example of an Organizational Structure for an Agile Learning Center. It includes a number of optional components (slightly greyed out) which you could remove for a simplified organization.

#### Sample Organizational Chart {#sample-organizational-chart}

So, let’s explore the elements in this diagram, why they exist and what they do. We’ll start with the easiest ones to talk about and remove if you want to simplify the model.

**New York State University Board of Regents:** This example illustrates that the NYSU Board of Regents is actually the final arbiter of any changes to the school’s Charter. Most states don’t have this kind of requirement, so it can be removed altogether in those cases.

**Volunteers:** Volunteers do not need to be acknowledged in the legal structure of the organization. It is included to show that they are a group of stakeholders overseen by the School Administration and specifically the Staff.

**Advisors:** You may want to have your legal structure specify the ability to include Advisors and explicitly limit their liability in the operation of the organization. This could allow you to approach relevant thought leaders or influential community members and provide a high-profile way to include them while not surrendering the communities self-direction to them, nor putting them in a position of significant liability for the organization. You can leave them out of your bylaws, or include the possibility of electing them and just leave that body empty of members.

**Charter Council:** This is a small group (around 5) of vision-holders who can hold true to the core purpose of the organization. If you are going to open your governance to the community, the Charter Council provides a kind of backstop from a “hostile takeover” by some random group of parents who might want to hijack the school to take it a completely different direction. The Charter Council has no power or accountability in school policy or daily operations, but it has a kind of ultimate power to rewrite the bylaws to legally restructure the school to disband the Assembly or any other group. Generally, they probably only need to meet once a year just to make sure the legal structures are supporting fulfillment of the school’s vision. Remember: Some people can be members of multiple bodies (e.g. Charter Council, Assembly & Staff).

**Assembly:** This body operates as the School Board or the Board of Directors of the organization. We actually keep the policy-making and decision making of this larger body fairly narrow so that most of the work can get done in smaller more productive groups. It’s formal duties are electing its own members, advisors and officers, approving the budget, approving staff appointments, generating necessary workgroups who summarize their actions, proposing changes to bylaws, and empowering the School Administration for policy-making and daily operations.

In NYC, we’ve taken the approach of having the first signer on a student’s Enrollment Agreement be a family’s representative on the board (even if they never come to a meeting). We see this providing opportunity for parent engagement, ownership and leadership as well as providing a strange sort of liability protection from frivolous lawsuits (If they wanted to sue the school for some policy, or attempt to “pierce the corporate veil” for neglect of fiduciary duties, they would essentially be accusing and suing themselves as well.).

**Work Committees:** These are also called “workgroups” in this document. This is where the real value and work of the Assembly happens. Workgroups such as the Finance Committee, Admissions Committee, Marketing & Outreach, Graduation Requirements, etc. Assembly Meetings actually have some initial time for workgroups to work (make plans, decisions, and schedules) and create their summary BEFOREHAND so that they’re ready to report results to the Assembly during the larger group time.

**School Administration:** In an Agile Learning Center, the School Administration handles the daily operation and facilitation of the school environment. It includes the students, staff, Director and potentially other Officers. It also clarifies some of the accountabilities of the adults versus the children. Specifically, according to laws in most jurisdictions, the adults are liable for safety, legal compliance, financial responsibility and supervision of volunteers. Having witnessed students struggling with power-tripping and emotional trauma, we have also put Admissions and Expulsions in this category as things which should include feedback from students, but adults are ultimately accountable for the final decision. The law certainly treats the adults (not children) as accountable for these things in terms of discrimination or emotional damage lawsuits.

However, for decisions affecting the bulk of the students’ time, attention, and behavior, these are made with the participation of the students. Currently most ALCs do this through a Change-Up Meeting using a Community Mastery Board while doing GameShifting to keep things light and agile and ensure the students have agency in every part of the process including the social modes of interaction while making decisions.

**Note:** Some people wonder whether ALCs are like Democratic Free Schools; the answer is mostly “Yes, of course.” However, this is a core difference, we don’t want a bureaucratic / democratic meeting revolving around a fixed process (like Robert’s Rules of Order or Butler’s Consensus) which creates interactions that yield a culture of argumentation, positionality, and inflexibility (because once you’ve spent dozens of hours getting a rule passed or policy made, you don’t want to start changing it even if it isn’t really working). We want everyone empowered to test and try changes, undo them and try again until the environment feels highly optimized for everyone.

### 501(c)3 Tax Exempt Status {#501-c-3-tax-exempt-status}

Schools as educational organizations generally qualify for [501c3 tax exempt status](http://www.irs.gov/Charities-%26-Non-Profits/Application-for-Recognition-of-Exemption) with the IRS, which makes donations tax deductible for the donors and may qualify you for grants or other types of funding reserved for 501c3 organizations. However, the [application](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1023.pdf) is complex (almost 30 pages) and can take months of back-and-forth correspondence to get approved. This is probably not a good use of time and energy of a busy founding team in early stages of start-up since approval may be retroactively applied to 2 years of contributions.

For early stage operations, crowdfunding campaigns, or significant donations you may want to use another 501c3 organization as a Fiscal Sponsor. Typically, a fiscal sponsor will charge a 5 to 10 percent administrative fee and have some reporting requirements for how the money was used so that their records show funds were properly used for tax-exempt purposes. The Agile Learning Centers Network is willing to provide fiscal sponsorship to start-up groups who are agile organizations creating educational spaces for self-directed learning. Please [contact us](http://alc.network/contact) to explore establishing that kind of relationship.
