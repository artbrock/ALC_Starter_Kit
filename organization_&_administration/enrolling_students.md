## Enrolling Students {#enrolling-students}

Please see the communications section for resources to help target and attract families to your school. This section is about the administration of the admissions and enrollment process.

### Tracking Prospects {#tracking-prospects}

You need an organized system for keeping track of prospect that you are in various stages of conversation with. At first, little sticky notes and lists seem manageable, but soon they become a tangled mess. So if you want to be able to follow up on a conversation from last month, last quarter, or last year, you’ll need a well organized approach. We recommend having them in a shared space so that others teammates can pick up each other’s progress if necessary. Here are some options from simple to sophisticated:

#### Google Spreadsheet {#google-spreadsheet}

Create a shared Google Apps Spreadsheet. Put a new student prospect in each row with columns for things like: Parents Name(s), Child’s name, Age, Phone #, Email, etc. Then more columns for stages of the process: Initial contact, Attended Event, Follow up, Application Submitted, etc. Also, you’ll probably want to have a big column for notes about your conversations, because you will almost certainly forget the details a month or two later after talking with 20 other families and children.

You can also use another tab/worksheet in the same document for tracking people once they’ve really entered the admissions process (submitted an application) to track the logistics of scheduling visiting weeks, collecting contracts, records, tuition deposits, etc.

#### Trello Board {#trello-board}

If you use a tool like Trello for coordinating tasks in school workgroups, or for recording student Kanbans, or recording your CMB, you may find that it is fun to set up a prospects board with columns for different states in the process. Then you can move people’s cards through the stages of the process until completion.

Again you may want to create a separate board for the Admissions process after students submit Applications, just to keep track of payments and the logistics of collecting their various documents.

#### Using CRM System {#using-crm-system}

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems can be very powerful and useful, but there is often a steep learning curve in getting one built, configured and keeping it up to date. If you have people with experience setting up and using CRM systems, and your team is comfortable using a sophisticated system, then you may want to try this out. In the long run, having a CRM system will provide greater value than the other alternatives in your ability to create reports, mailing list, and track touchpoints and participation of people. But in the short run, it can be a lot of work get it started.

[SalesForce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/) is free for use by non-profit organizations. [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/) and [SugarCRM](http://www.sugarcrm.com/) are also free and popular open source alternatives. Be sure you have someone with the technical skills to set up, customize and support your CRM system if you decide to use an open source tool.

### Admissions Process {#admissions-process}

It is important to have an admissions process that provides a clear path for people to follow and clear status for you to manage so that people who actually want to come to your school don’t get lost in a complex process.

A sample process might look like:

*   **Prospect** -- You receive someone’s information either because they contacted you or were referred to you. Invite them to engage.
*   **Orientation** -- A visit, phone conversation, or attendance at an event or Parent Interest Night. Invite them to apply.
*   **Application** -- They signify their interest by completing the Online Application (and payment of any application fee and completion of the Tuition Worksheet if they are requesting financial assistance). Invite them to schedule a visiting period.
*   **Visiting Period** -- The student to attends for some days or a week to see whether they are a good fit for the school’s culture and capacities.
*   **Final Review** -- Negotiation of terms of acceptance (or rejection) including any special coverage for needs of their student, tuition amount, payment timelines, etc. to be put into their Enrollment Agreement. Invite them to enroll.

You should at least track people’s status in major steps of the process and you may also want to keep track of other touchpoints like communications by phone, voicemail or email throughout their admissions process.

### Final Paperwork {#final-paperwork}

*   **Enrollment Agreement:** Yay! You have a family ready to commit! The first (and MOST IMPORTANT) step is to formalize the enrollment of their child(ren) with an Enrollment Agreement. This is the contract which makes them responsible for paying tuition and you responsible for providing a safe educational setting. (Link to Sample)
*   **Tuition Deposit:** If possible get your tuition deposit when they sign the Enrollment Agreement. If they can’t make the full payment at that time, make sure the timing of payments are clear, and ideally automate them using the the instructions above so that you don’t have to keep thinking about it.
*   **Other Important Paperwork:** (to get before school starts)
    *   Emergency Contact Info (sample)
    *   Medical Contact Info, Instructions & Authorization (sample)
    *   Immunization Records (sample)
    *   School Exit Permissions (can kids leave the school alone, with teens, with staff) (sample)
    *   General Permission Slip (for field trips/outings with staff and volunteers) (sample)
