## Being an Agile Learning Facilitator (ALF) {#being-an-agile-learning-facilitator-alf}

Being an ALF includes four major areas of endeavor:

1.  Uphold Safety
2.  Facilitate Learning
3.  Develop Authentic Relationships
4.  Model FOR THE CHILDREN (Model the Model, MitM, Be a Role Model, Model everything good ever, Model the Message, Model Self-Actualization Dammit, Model Being Awesome, Model Your Best Life)

**Safety**: ALFs help ensure that the choices made by students and facilitators are physically and emotionally safe, legal, and respectful. Physical safety includes making sure that tools are used appropriately, people are accounted for, and no one’s body is in harm’s way, no bodily harm, minimizing risk of serious injury. Emotional safety includes working with students to keep the space free from bullying, ensure everyone feels they can express themselves without fear, there is emotional support, no harassment, and that each student is seen as a human being whose thoughts and feelings are valid. No attacking with words. Confining options to those legally permissible helps ensure that the school can continue to exist and operate. Choices must respect the needs and feelings of others in the ALC and in the greater community. Know that there is inherent authority in the ALF-Student / Adult-Child relationship. Don’t abdicate your authority. Own your authority while supporting their autonomy.

**Facilitate Learning**: To “facilitate” means to “make easy.” An ALF supports student learning by being aware of and removing barriers to the intention-creation-reflection-sharing cycle. Encourage them to create/meet challenges, change relationship to failure / healthy relationship to failure, define their own success, space organization, bring offerings, support their offerings, set and hold rhythms, reflect student choices for them to see, nurture individual growth

Support the kids offerings and passions. Don’t get attached to your own offerings or activities. Leave space to dive into their projects with them, or just spend time with them with no agenda other than to connect with them as people. Find/harness/ignite sparks/passions/personal intelligences/competences Look for what the kid loves and do it with them

And/or support kids in opportunities / ways to connect with that Stay solution-oriented (See the learning everywhere -- if this broke, why?)

Look for and speak to the opportunity for growth when something doesn’t work

**Develop Authentic Relationship**: “enforce” student agreement, honesty, dependability, vulnerability, own your feelings, effective communication, spend time to get to know them, being available, don’t be afraid to tell kids when you have made a mistake and let them observe the process of you fixing it, be real, listen to them, embody student agreements Embody Community Agreements

Every Agile Learning Center has a contract that a student signs agreeing to honor themselves, others, the space, to participate in the group process and to honor the agreements of the community. The facilitator’s job is to remember these agreements, honor the agreements themselves, be honest and forgiving of themselves when they don’t, and come back to them as soon as possible. Managing personal JudgementsSelf Talk - openness about what’s actually going on for you and not hiding your thought, feelings, and fears, but speaking of them appropriately, responsibly, and within a context of growth and intentionality Show how you really feel! Hiding it means that people don’t know what’s actually up for you, vulnerability creates the opportunity for genuine connection (need story to distinguish between over-sharing personal stuff, to being open and honest with kids about frustration with things in the school- distinction

**Modeling**: support yourself, get support,, trust kids/process/other ALFs, being engageable/engagement, self-awareness, self-care, co-create intentional culture

Model powerful, curious, authentic self-possession; communication; respectful relationships, Use of the tools, showing how to use the tools, Foster and nourish healthy relationships with and among members of the community, Foster member’s of the community’s gifts

Challenges happen in culture creation, self-direction, and community building - know that we’ve all had similar experiences and that you have access to a network of people who had shared experiences! Don’t hesitate to reach out for support! make requests

Own what’s yours / Don’t put your things on to others Be REAL / Own what you’re feeling

Talk about your expectations and disappointments without making others feel responsible for your happiness / disappointments

Eventually, some of your kids will probably step powerfully into co-facilitating the space! This is good! This is an example of your community holding itself.

### Coherence Holders {#coherence-holders}

### Supporting ALFs {#supporting-alfs}

### Intentional Culture Creation {#intentional-culture-creation}

Many people imagine that culture is something that we must simply accept, that it is unchangeable. The truth is we can create and change culture intentionally, especially within a smaller community, such as a business or school. This phenomenon has become more apparent since the advent of the internet, which made a variety and diversity of subcultures more visible.

Agile tools like the Community Mastery Board, Change-Up Meeting, and Gameshifting are all ways of making culture creation at your school visible and participatory, allowing each member of the community to embed values and behaviors into the culture without oppressive rules or overbearing structure. These tools make implicit cultural norms explicit, help us practice new patterns of behavior through social agreement, and enhance accountability using increased visibility of intentions and results.

When co-created culture becomes the new norm, the need to manipulate others’ behavior through punishments, incentives, or rewards is diminished. When people are invited to participate in culture creation, they are more invested in supporting it.

When it comes to starting your school, think of your environment as Petri dish: a fertile ground on which many different strains, or bacterial _cultures_, could develop. Those founding the school are the scientists in this scenario: they choose which types of bacterial _cultures_ to put in the dish. This is an important power: because culture creation at your school will be a participatory process, know that these selections will grow and develop the school with your from this point forwards. Admissions is your opportunity to seed the school with values and personalities you want to hold.

As you run your initial admissions process, you may want to honor this metaphor by starting with a single strain of bacteria. Admitting kids and families who are aligned with the type of culture you want will not only create a strong culture, it will make bringing in (and enculturation) new strains of bacteria easier.

You might be worried that your fellow community members will create a culture that you're not fond of (this could mean students, ALFs, or even parents). Remember, as addressed in the ALF Role section, there's not a need for you to abdicate your authority in this situation -- just for you to be real about it.

### Tools / Practices / Structures {#tools-practices-structures}

The tools are the leaves of the Agile Tree, and are therefore not as fundamental as the roots and branches. As a group they are essential to help the tree nourish and feed itself; however, no individual leaf is essential to the health of the tree. Tools may be useful on a daily basis, or only a couple times a year. They may have a season of much usefulness, and they can be set aside when they are not currently of service.

As you facilitate, you will collaboratively determine which tools to use and when, and how to adapt them to the needs of your ALC and individual students. Here are the tools we’ve found very helpful within what we want to achieve, roots-wise, that have worked well:

#### Set-the-week Meeting {#set-the-week-meeting}

Set-the-week is the first meeting of the week, which includes introducing and creating the schedule for any opportunities that week. If resource people are coming in to the school at a particular time to hold a class, it is important that this make it onto the schedule so other more flexible activities can be planned around the special offerings.

This is also the time when we identify projects that are going to take multiple days to accomplish, and set weekly intentions. We might set time aside each day to work toward that goal. This is sometimes referred to as a “weekly sprint.” For example, the students may want to perform a play at the end of the week. At the set-the-week meeting, they might decide that every day at 10am, they will hold rehearsal until lunchtime. Milestones can be set so we can track progress toward the goal, ie. on Tuesday we will do blocking, by Thursday everyone must know their lines. At the end of the week, we assess the progress that was made and document it. INSERT PICTURE OF SET THE WEEK BOARD

#### Offerings Board {#offerings-board}

The Offerings Board lists available class offerings, opportunities, and resources. Agile Learning Facilitators (ALFs), resource people in the community, and the children themselves can contribute offerings. A resource person in the community may offer to teach their craft or host a field trip to allow children to experience it. The offerings board may be its own board or integrated into the Set-the-Week board.

#### Scrum {#scrum}

A scrum is a period of about five to ten minutes before a group scheduling meeting in which people lay the groundwork for setting the schedule by coordinating individual or small-group connections. This prepares them to announce intentions and have working time slots for when the larger group scheduling is happening. Scrum is a good time to make **requests** of others pertaining to activities for the day. Scrum is usually noisy and a bit chaotic as everyone zips around quickly to prepare for the group meeting.

#### Morning Intentions / Stand-up Meeting {#morning-intentions-stand-up-meeting}

The daily stand-up meetings happen in the morning and are conducted, not surprisingly, while participants stand. Standing keeps the energy up at the beginning of the day and gets everyone in the mode to do. In this meeting, each group member states their intentions for the day and makes any requests for support they may need. A whole-group kanban board is often used at this meeting. This simple process takes only about ten to fifteen minutes, but serves an important purpose of starting each day with intention and accountability. By continually engaging in this practice, students are cultivating highly useful skills in time-management, teamwork, self-awareness and self-assessment.

#### Closing Meeting / Afternoon Reflections {#closing-meeting-afternoon-reflections}

The learning cycle that begins with Morning Intentions comes full circle at the end of the day with a sit-down meeting for reflection. We take this time to ask, "Did we accomplish what we intended to?" If so, how? If not, why not? This creates space for daily reflection on individual and group productivity. This feedback cycle stimulates a growing sense of self-awareness in each learner, allowing them to move forward more powerfully.

#### Spawn Points {#spawn-points}

Once an ALC grows beyond a handful of students, it becomes essential to break certain meetings into smaller groups for efficiency, and to maintain spaces where communication and sharing can be authentic. Spawn points are comprised of a group of 7 (+/- 2) students and one facilitator that gather in the morning and afternoon to encompass the morning and closing meeting patterns. Spawn point meetings usually last 5-10 minutes.

This is a space for connections between facilitators and students to develop and where information is shared that can inform what kind of support students are needing. It’s best to have your full-time (lead) facilitators be responsible for holding spawn points (or at least consistently participating in them if students wind up taking over ownership over running them). This ensures that certain students aren’t falling through the cracks and that each of them feel heard, acknowledged and supported by the facilitators. Spawn point groupings can also support the documentation of work, in that, each spawn point has a leader whose role is to make sure Trello boards are updated.

#### Personal Kanban {#personal-kanban}

Kanban is Japanese for “card signal.” A basic Kanban is divided into Backlog, Ready, Doing, and Done columns and utilizes sticky notes to populate the board with ideas, intentions, work in progress (WIP), and items that have been done. The Backlog consists of things students want to do, explore, or create. On a daily basis, each person’s list of possibilities are evaluated, prioritized, visualized, and eventually pulled into the “Doing” column. The kanban board is a flexible tool that can be adjusted according to what works best for its user.

Two guidelines of Kanban are Visualize Your Work and Limit Your Work In Progress (WIP). When we visualize our work, it creates a path for actually completing what we intend. It helps us to stay focused and creates accountability for ourselves. We limit our work in progress in order to deeply engage in what we are doing. Using the Kanban teaches us how to effectively prioritize and honor our time by making conscious choices about what we are engaging in.

Here is a simple sample Kanban board:

#### Gratitude Circle / Community Rituals {#gratitude-circle-community-rituals}

Some ALCs have added a group ritual to end the day. The agreements and process around the ritual are iterated through the Change-UP meeting. One example of this type of ritual looks like this:

Each student and facilitator has their own candle. A different candle is selected each day and placed in the center of the circle. The student who’s candle is chosen gets to “hold the meeting”, which may mean they get to choose certain aspects of the process, structure, and desired outcome.

The ritual typically involves some period of silence, followed by sharing of gratitudes, acknowledgements, or general reflections. The ritual is designed to bring the whole group together and to give ourselves the power to write a positive record of the day, while overtime creating a positive culture that emphasizes joy, play, gratitude, and a healthy relationship to failure/success.

#### GameShifting {#gameshifting}

GameShifting is a tool that allows a community to better facilitate meetings. Part of its purpose is to make the implicit social rules explicit, and thus give permission to change them. It can help the group alter its dynamic so it can function more efficiently to accomplish different sorts of tasks. The fancy word for this is “polymorphism”: taking many forms. Groups often get stuck in singular patterns: the teacher is in charge, the boss must be pleased, tip toe around the executive secretary, some people talk and others listen. When groups get stuck in those patterns, creativity and the ability to adapt are impaired. While a singular existing pattern might be usable for one type of outcome, it limits the group to that one kind of outcome. Being able to intentionally change the patterns helps groups engage polymorphically: they can take many forms, and achieve many kinds of outcomes. The GameShifting process takes the individual cycle of intention, creation, reflection, and applies it to group dynamics. Students learn how groups can rapidly change forms to accomplish different things, and can apply these skills to resolve conflicts and create and explore together.

The GameShifting Board is a visual aid to assist in GameShifting. They are adaptable to many different kinds of groups and meetings. A sample whiteboard is divided into categories like Mode, Interaction style, Body arrangement, Body energy, Roles, and Start/End. A good example of what each category might mean is the Start/End section, which says Start: on time, threshold, attendance. A marker (a small magnet works well) is placed beside the convention we decide to follow, whether the meeting will start on time at 9am, or when we feel we have enough people to start, or when the required attendees show up. If we decide to follow a different convention, we can move the marker. This helps make intentional culture, makes group dynamics smarter, and helps us alter the dynamics as needed. For example, are we jumping in, or are we raising our hands? The Gameshifting Board both asks and answers that question as we make use of it, and helps us be intentional about the dynamics we are working in.

#### Hand Signals {#hand-signals}

In order to keep discussions productive and efficient, we employ hand-signals that serve as visual communication. When we speak one-on-one with each other, we rely on non-verbal communication cues that don’t always translate well to a group setting. Hand signals supply the group with instant feedback without interrupting a speaker. Hand signals make non-verbal communication explicit and deliberate by replacing subtle cues with intentional, well-defined ones.

![photo 3.JPG](assets/photo_3jpg.jpeg)

**Twinkle fingers / “This friend speaks my mind”** - this signal is done with wiggling fingers and demonstrates strong resonance with what is being spoken.

**Delta / Change-up:** a call to attention that the group process may need to be GameShifted or that the current process agreements are not being honored. A person can give this hand signal so others can have a chance to wrap up what they’re saying before they say what change-up they see is needed.![photo 1.JPG](assets/photo_1jpg.jpeg)

Sometimes the sign is enough to shift people’s awareness and behavior back on the intended track.

**Got ya / “You have been heard”** - This signal is held over the heart and means that the listener has understood the speaker’s point. It includes a gentle nudge that the speaker may move on and release it to the group. It is often helpful when the speaker is repeating a point in different words. If they know they are understood, they know they can move on. For example, this explanation may have warranted a “got ya” sign a sentence or two ago. The explanation continues in order to be sure the point is driven home, but if someone was here to utilize the “got ya” sign, it would have saved us all some valuable reading time.![photo 2.JPG](assets/photo_2jpg.jpeg)

There are a number of other hand-signals created for various needs: Stay on Focus, Trust the Group, Clarification Question, Slow-Down, Direct Response, etc. You should feel free to create new signals for shifting and signaling dynamics as needed in your community.

#### Change-up meetings {#change-up-meetings}

Change-up meetings are attended by the whole community at a frequency determined by the individual community. They are characterized by the use of the Community Mastery Board to initiate, implement, and evaluate issues or problems that affect the community. Issues (called “awarenesses”) are brought up, solutions are brainstormed, and an action is decided upon (using “sense of the meeting”). This isn’t a time to flesh out all the reasons why a solution may be a good idea or not, just a quick brainstorm and a decision to try something for a week. It is suggested that any change-up meeting cover only a manageable number of awarenesses - three is a good rule of thumb.

#### Community Mastery Board (CMB) {#community-mastery-board-cmb}

A CMB is a tool by which culture is created. It is divided into 4 columns: Awareness (community-wide problems that need resolution), Implementation (the decided-upon action for each awareness), Practicing (the changes we are currently practicing), and Mastery, which means the change has then become the new established norm, and a bit of culture has been created. ![photoA.JPG](assets/photoajpg.jpeg)

*   **Practices**
    *   Keep meetings to less than 30 minutes (15-20 is ideal)
    *   Limit your WIP: just like a personal workflow, a community can only implement so many new solutions or practices at once. Stay tuned in to what feels like a manageable number of new agreements to implement each cycle, and notice when too many agreements in the practicing column causes collective attention to those agreements to breakdown.
    *   Find a way to make sure “mastered” agreements are visible to visitors and new students. Everyone in your ALC may know that you only eat in the food room because that practice made its way through your CMB months ago and has not come up since, but people entering your space for the first time won’t have a clue. Make sure you give newbies the information they need to operate effectively in your community.

#### Culture Committee {#culture-committee}

Serves to bolster open communication and intentional culture creation and is comprised of both ALFs and students. Its role is twofold: to help solve conflicts and to brainstorm ways to improve the culture of the learning community. In engaging in this process, the culture becomes stronger and more cohesive.

**Conflict Resolution:** When a person finds themselves in a conflict, the first step is to stop, take a breath, and think about how to handle it. Then they can talk through the problem with the other party and/or ask for help in talking with the person. When a problem cannot be solved with these basic steps, a person can fill out a Request to Meet form to be sent to the Culture Committee. The Culture Committee meets on a regular basis and will talk through the conflict with the requester in order to come up with an action plan. If necessary, the other party may be brought in to the meeting to facilitate the resolution.

**Improving the Culture:** The “preventative care” of the Culture Committee is to create conditions that minimize conflict, finding the root cause and underlying cultural conditions that need change. The committee might find issues that they think need to be addressed within the community, which they can then bring to the Change-up meeting that is attended by all of the learning community members.

#### Blogging {#blogging}

Blogging fulfills the agile cycle of learning by creating sharable value and serve as our upgrade to the report card. This record becomes a digital portfolio of work that is student-generated. This compendium of interests and accomplishments serves as a feedback loop so students can see what they keep returning to, and recognize patterns in their own learning.

It can serve to provide parents with a sense of security and safety, because colleges and employers will look at an online portfolio. The President of Harvard recently addressed parents on the topic of how to get their children into Ivy League schools: “Encourage children to follow their passions as a way to develop an interesting personality.” The portfolio is an innovative way for our students to demonstrate how interesting they are.

Other tools for documenting student activities can be useful for faster, lighter-weight records. We have found it effective to use [Trello](http://trello.com) [to](http://trello.com) digitize each student’s personal kanban and easily add pictures and support links on the fly. All of this can be done from a smartphone and is often a great place to refer to when composing a blog at the end of a week.

*   *   Student agreements
    *   Weekly ALF calls
    *   Boundaries to participating in this ALC
        *   “I am comfortable holding this space if we hold ourselves to these agreements”
        *   When things go wrong, there is a conversation to understand why -- Needs not being met? Lack of understanding?
        *   What boundaries do the adults hold very strongly? i.e. no punching in the face, you are out if you do this
    *   One on one conversations / time
        *   Important, relationship-building

### Who’s in your community? (Community membranes / How do you support these groups?) {#who-s-in-your-community-community-membranes-how-do-you-support-these-groups}

    *   When they start deschooling?
    *   How can they use the work for personal growth?
    *   Holistic
    *   Being able to say no
    *   Identifying false beliefs
    *   Interacting with parents, hearing their hurt
    *   Communicating and coordinating with your other f

**Parents / Families**

**Participants**

*   What draws people to Agile Learning? What types of parents / kids might you come across?
    *   Recognized hurting the school system
    *   Not fitting in elsewhere (advancing through the system is not working)
    *   Being held back elsewhere (can’t learn as quickly as desired)
        *   For any of the above, could be behavioral/academic/developmental
    *   Already unschooling/homeschooling elsewhere
*   What to do when you realize that someone’s not a good fit?
    *   Good boundaries at the beginning (agreements, trial period, etc)
    *   Conversation about why the fit isn’t working
    *   What if you take kids on who aren’t a great fit because you want to keep the school alive?

*   **Training More Facilitators:**

### Deschooling {#deschooling}

*   What is it? What should you look for?
*   Detoxification / deschooling (for the kids)
    *   Stories that explain what you might experience in public school vs ALC
    *   Being able to wait with kids for the flame to light up again
    *   Finding the right fuel light (can you see how the kid wants to learn?)

Commitments:

ALCs require the creation of a microculture - a set of ethics, expectations, and language that is particular to the group of people involved with the project. We have to be clear on the differences between the microculture we’re creating and the greater culture wherein we exist. If we communicate without judgement about those differences to new people, they will understand what we are doing and be able to determine whether or not they want to play with us. It is important that this communication be nonjudgmental: if we talk about the culture as “wrong” and “bad” and not just “different,” then we polarize ourselves and close ourselves off to people who want to be a part of it. Welcome people to engage in whatever way they feel comfortable, and make pathways to engage clear and accessible.

Essential to an ALC microculture is a commitment to open and honest communication. Facilitators

Instead of place of fear for others’ judgments, we come from a place of enthusiasm for other people’s lessons and observations If you’re giving me feedback that I know is to support me then I can can feel open to really hearing and it strengthens my commitment to being in communication. , around the cultural boundaries that we’re upholding

Creating and nurturing a vibrant flourishing microculture.

Being able to communicate honestly with everyone involved in an ALC project is very important because it facilitates problem solving, helps everyone understand each other, and helps us learn to care about each other as people and individuals. When people can’t talk about issues and problems, they end up throwing immature fits and leave in a huff. Can’t continue to work together. We have to communicate honestly openly and regularly. When communication gets challenging, we have to redouble our efforts to talk to one another. We support each other’s growth and change. So much of what we do cultural barriers being aware of influences of greater culture, respect greater culture while creating our own. Building
