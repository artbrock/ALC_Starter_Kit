## A Week In Facilitation: An ALFing Narrative {#a-week-in-facilitation-an-alfing-narrative}

This is a story of a week’s experiences as an ALF.

**Monday**:

Alice arrived at school early on Monday morning. Kris was already there working on an email for parents. “Last week I noticed that when some kids were working hard on the marble track project, George and Carlos were distracting them and not respecting their space, making it hard for them to focus,”

**Intentional Culture Creation**: discussion with other facilitator before kids get to school about cultural awareness and what to work on this week with some pre-coordinating about the set-the-week meeting for supporting the school’s culture.

**Set-the-Week**, Greeting children, checking in w/ parents, a kid’s parents are getting divorced, **spawn point**, cleaning, talking to other facilitator re: kid w/ issue, other ALF discusses **resource person** coming in maybe Wednesday, check in re: coordination, **kanban board**, **hang-out time** during spawn, talking about weekend, laughing, discuss intentions for day/week. Meeting ends, Set-the-week hustle/bustle scrambling scrumming, Set-the-Week board (side-box), Welding/cooking class/marine research station, **offerings from kids**, one offering from facilitator, reviewing a couple things from change-up slammed door. **Email parents about offering requirements** goes out to parents about special clothing requirements for welding. end of day **gratitude circle**

**Tuesday**:

Spawn Points

get into offerings:

**conflict resolution pathway:** we can see an issue starting to happen with Forrest’s behavior w/ another kid (took toy), tried to talk to specific parent about coordinating welding but had to talk to visitor instead, at pick up talk to parent about welding, play games of werewolves,, Gameshifting board in STW meeting, something on STW board gets changed because new opportunity showed up cool free dance thing so plan to play werewolves is disregarded. one person can’t do it because they have a cooking class. Facilitator is making more offerings and holding the space. (still a place for teaching!)

When one kid is being mean to another, important not to see them as the bad kid. Need to have capacity to view “mean” child w/ compassion and love. “That’s not cool, you’re being a jerk.” possible w/ some kids and not others based on relationship. Support kids not to victimize themselves: “Nancy hit me!” “How are you feeling?” “I’m angry.” “Ok let’s take a breath together.” They breathe in and out. “”do you feel comfortable talking to him or do you need support? Do you need to think about it for a while? Culture committee meeting with that person?” “I don’t feel like filling out that form. I’m just going to go play.” Alice knows that if this becomes a repeating problem, the answer may someday become, “Yes, I do want to fill out a Culture Committee form. I’m tired of Nancy hitting me.”

**Minecraft all day**: one kid plays minecraft all day and does so each day, facilitator joins him at points to learn about what he’s doing and speak specifically to and of the value they see in it, and use that to understand some of the interests the kid has in the world, and on the on the last day he begins

**Conversation with Parent about Culture Creation**: Discussion with parents of kids who want to do focused work, and were getting distracted about the incremental change that we observed after we brought the awareness to the change-up meeting. This begins to allay parents concern, and contextualizes the change, not as a static fix, but as a process of shifting that is slow, but steady, observable, and happening.

**Wednesday**:

spawnpoint: slurchy. feels too much time coordinating/talking/meeting so we blow off the meeting. Owning failure w/ kids. Gameshifting?? Two kids are arguing and ALF snaps at them and walks away and then remembers that they didn’t know what was going on and acted out of personal reaction. Apologizes and listens for understanding and problem-solves w/ kids.

**Weekly ALF Network call.** Parent freaking out b/c kid is playing MC, discuss during call. Go look at ALF blog and find tag that addresses that concern. Read about how got handled.

**Thursday**: culture committee? Remind kid about student agreement. (slamming doors?) Conflict resolution process with kids’ disagreement: one person keeps messing up a makerspace project?

**Field trip**: half of the kids want to go uptown to flash mob. They can be spontaneous, assess surroundings and say, “I don’t think this is an appropriate spot.” kids push boundaries, you have to figure out which boundaries are ok. On lightrail swinging around poles, ok? Check w/ yourself, what kind of freedom or flexibility you have. One kid starts goofing off in the middle of the street. Won’t stand in a straight line, must be flexible and trusting, always make sure you know where everyone is. Love/appreciate that you look a little weird (flash mob) and that’s ok; those norms, if not dangerous, can be uncomfortable but…

**Friday**: Minecraft kid stops playing MC,

**Change-up Meeting**: check in re: Masteries, Practicing, etc, new awarenesses: too much time in meetings? 90% of kids’ time is their own, keep meetings lean.
